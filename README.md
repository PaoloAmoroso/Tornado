# Tornado
Panavia Tornado for FlightGear

Phil from Virtavia:
You can have permission to use our current FSX Tornado ADV and use its MDL's and textures to create an FG version. All I ask is, as before, you give credit to Virtavia for the source material, your creations remain freeware and you do not allow any public access to the new source files you create (expect for textures, that's OK). And please can you purchase a single copy of the FSX Tornado from your favourite FS vendor.
